# CHAOS: THE ELEMENTAL TRIAL — PRE-VISIT FAQ (SHORT & LOUD)

You’ve got the link: chaos.malick.wtf. You don’t need a tutorial, you need a briefing.

**Mission?**  
Save Peons. One card per round, seven rounds. If you finish with Peons still breathing, you win. If they all die, you’re the disaster.

**What actually matters?**  
Mana and shields. You start with 125 Mana. Every card costs Mana. If you can’t pay, that card is just shiny cardboard.

**What’s a General Shield, tough guy?**  
It’s the big, bad shield with a badge. When things like “Asteroid Impact” show up, a General Shield is the difference between “close call” and “new crater where your city used to be.”

**Rally… like a party in the rubble?**  
Exactly. Chaos event + perfect primary match = Rally. Instead of losing Peons, you GAIN them. The world almost ends, and your people throw a festival.

**Peon math (no calculator, no whining):**  
Event damage − card mitigation = Peon change.  
Primary match: big reduction (or Rally on Chaos).  
Secondary match: small reduction.  
No match: full pain. Hope you said goodbye.

**Pro tips before you click Play:**  
- Don’t run a one-element clown deck. Mix your elements.  
- Don’t blow all your Mana in Round 1 unless you enjoy tragic montages.  
- Keep a General Shield in reserve for when the sky starts throwing rocks.

**Controls for heroes:**  
Mouse or arrow keys + Enter. Themes and fullscreen are just extra swagger.

**If the site chokes:**  
Hit refresh. If it still sulks, use the support link (yeah, I know there isn't even one), grab a coffee, and try again. Real leaders don’t rage-quit.

Now go to `chaos.malick.wtf`, keep your Peons alive, and make the apocalypse wish it had picked another planet.
